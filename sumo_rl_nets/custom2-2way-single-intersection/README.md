This folder is based on the 2way-single-intersection of sumo-rl/nets
The difference being that it uses probabilities instead of vehicles per hours
and that it has 2 high traffic loads and 3 low traffic load periods.

The difference between custom2-2way-single-intersection and custom-2way-signle-intersection is that custom2 has a bigger difference between high and low traffic + it has a pause between each phase
